# Aperture Viewer Project Governance

## Our Philosophy: The Studio Model

The Aperture Viewer Project operates on a "Studio Model," not a consensus-driven or community-led model. Our development is internally directed, guided by a long-range, mission-oriented roadmap focused on ambitious research and development goals.

This model allows for high-velocity, focused engineering to solve complex problems, shielded from the diversions of public debate. While we value our community and users, the strategic direction of the project is not determined by public vote or feature request volume.

## Project Leadership

The project is managed by the "Aperture Development Team" and led by the **Director of Development**. The Director is the final arbiter on all strategic, technical, and design decisions. This centralized leadership ensures the project remains true to its core vision and long-term objectives.

## Decision Making

All major development priorities are mission-driven and are part of a multi-stage, predefined roadmap. Decisions on features, architecture, and release timing are made internally by the development team in service of these strategic goals.

## Contribution Process

Aperture Viewer is not a contribution-driven project, and we are not actively seeking external pull requests for new features. Our primary focus is on executing our internal R&D roadmap.

The GitHub issue tracker serves as our public-facing bug and regression tracking system. We welcome well-documented bug reports from the community, as they provide valuable data. However, the submission of a bug report or feature request does not guarantee its inclusion in our work queue. Priority is determined by the project leadership based on its alignment with our current mission objectives.

For more details on submitting bug reports, please see our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Code of Conduct

All project spaces and participants are governed by our **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. While our governance model is internal, our standards for respectful and kind communication are universal and strictly enforced.

## Conclusion

This governance model is intentionally designed to support a long-term, focused R&D mission. We thank you for your understanding and your interest in the Aperture Viewer Project.
