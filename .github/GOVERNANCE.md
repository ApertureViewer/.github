# Aperture Viewer Project Governance

## Our Guiding Philosophy: The Studio Model

The Aperture Viewer Project operates on a **Studio Model**. This is a deliberate choice to support a long-range, mission-oriented roadmap focused on ambitious research and development goals.

Our development is vision-led and internally directed, similar to a creative or R&D studio. This model allows for high-velocity, focused engineering to solve complex problems. While we value our community and users, the strategic direction of the project is not determined by public vote or consensus.

## Project Leadership

The project is led by the **Director of Development**, who guides the mission and is the final arbiter on all strategic, technical, and design decisions. This centralized leadership ensures the project remains true to its core vision.

All official communication originates from institutional roles.

## Our Mission & Vision

*   **Mission:** To empower virtual photographers and videomakers by providing the most advanced, intuitive, and powerful open-source viewer, focused on delivering unparalleled visual fidelity, artistic control, and a streamlined creative workflow.
*   **Vision:** To be the indispensable, benchmark viewer for visual creators in virtual worlds, continuously redefining the standards of graphical excellence, performance, and artistic capability, making Aperture Viewer the premier platform where "Nothing Is Not Possible."

## Project Status & Roadmap

Development priorities are mission-driven and follow a long-term, internally-directed roadmap. Major features and capabilities will be announced as they are completed and become available in a public release.

## Community Interaction & Contribution

While our roadmap is internally directed, we value our community. Interaction with the project is governed by the following protocols:

*   **Primary Information Hub:** For official downloads, announcements, and project information, please visit our website: **[apertureviewer.com](https://apertureviewer.com)**
*   **Bug Reports:** Well-documented bug reports are the primary way for the community to contribute. They should be submitted via the **GitHub Issues** tracker. Please note that submission does not guarantee a fix, as all work is prioritized against our current mission objectives.
*   **Pull Requests:** We are **not** a contribution-driven project and are not actively seeking external pull requests for new features. The development branch is fast-moving, and external contributions are difficult to integrate with our internal R&D roadmap.
*   **Communication Channels:** Our public communication channels are primarily one-way.
    *   **Discord Server:** Serves as an announcement channel for releases and important updates. It is not a live support or chat forum.
    *   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Must be reported privately as per our **[Security Policy](SECURITY.md)**.

We do **not** offer live interactive support or guaranteed response times. Our public channels are designed to be self-serve, supported by our documentation on the project Wiki.

## Code of Conduct

All project spaces and participants are governed by our **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. While our governance model is centralized, our standards for respectful and kind communication are universal and strictly enforced.
