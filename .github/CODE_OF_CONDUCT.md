# Aperture Viewer Project: Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Aperture Viewer is more than software; it is a commitment to artistic possibility and a positive community experience. In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and kind environment, we as project leadership pledge to make participation in our project and our community a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We believe in leading with an open ear and a genuine desire to be gentle and understanding. We recognize that for many, life's journey can be challenging, and virtual worlds often provide a space for hope, warmth, and connection. We are committed to upholding these values in all project spaces.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

*   Being kind, welcoming, and inclusive in all interactions.
*   Respecting differing viewpoints, experiences, and technical skill levels.
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
*   Focusing on what is best for the project and its community.
*   Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities & Enforcement

The project leadership is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The project leadership has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, the project's Discord server, and any other official communication channels. It also applies when an individual is representing the Aperture Viewer project in public spaces.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project's Ground Control at **contact@apertureviewer.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
