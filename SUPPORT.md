# Contact and Support Policy

**Effective Date:** September 3, 2025

---

### I. Our Philosophy

Aperture Viewer is a free, open-source R&D project created for artists and developers. Our primary focus is on pioneering new tools for virtual cinematography, real-time rendering, and creation in shared digital spaces.

To maintain our focus on high-speed, innovative development with a small team, this policy outlines the boundaries and methods for community interaction.

---

### II. Interactive Support

Aperture Viewer is offered as-is and does not provide direct, interactive, or personal user support. Our support model is entirely self-serve. We do not offer:

- Live chat or helpdesk services (e.g., via Discord).
- Support via direct messages (DMs), in-world IMs, or one-on-one sessions.
- Email-based technical support for individual user problems.
- Creative or artistic advice on how to use the software.

Our resources must remain dedicated to software development.

---

### III. Self-Serve Resources & Documentation

We are committed to providing clear, comprehensive documentation for the features that are **unique to Aperture Viewer.** We expect users to consult these resources to learn how to operate the software.

These are the only official channels for learning about our exclusive features:

1.  **The Aperture Viewer Wiki (The User Manual):**
    `https://github.com/ApertureViewer/Aperture-Viewer/wiki`  
    This is the official user manual and your first source of information. It explains what our custom tools do and how to use them.

2.  **The Aperture Viewer YouTube Channel (Visual Guides):**
    `https://www.youtube.com/@ApertureViewer`  
    This channel provides video demonstrations of our most powerful and unique features.

> [!NOTE]  
> We do **not** provide documentation for standard viewer functions that are also found in our upstream sources (the official Second Life Viewer and the Firestorm Viewer). For help with common features, please refer to the excellent and extensive resources provided by those projects.

### IV. Bug Reports

We value our community as a distributed quality assurance network. We accept bug reports for issues that are **exclusive to Aperture Viewer** through our GitHub Issues tracker, under the following strict conditions.

**URL:** `https://github.com/ApertureViewer/Aperture-Viewer/issues`

To ensure reports are clear and actionable, all submissions **must use the mandatory "Bug Report" template provided.** Reports that are incomplete or do not use the template will be **immediately closed without comment.**

The bug report template requires:
- A clear, descriptive title.
- The exact Aperture Viewer version number.
- Your Operating System and GPU model.
- **Clear, unambiguous steps that allow a developer to reliably reproduce the bug.**
- The attachment of the **full log file (`logs/SecondLife.log`)** from immediately after the bug occurred.
- A confirmation that you have verified the issue does **not** occur on the latest official Linden Lab and Firestorm viewers.

By submitting a bug report, you acknowledge that you are providing valuable technical feedback to an open-source project. This does not guarantee a personal response or a specific timeline for a fix. All development work is prioritized based on our internal roadmap.

---

### V. Contributions We Do Not Accept

The project's roadmap is internally managed. Therefore:

- **We do NOT accept unsolicited feature requests** on any platform, including GitHub.
- **We do NOT accept code contributions (Pull Requests)** that have not been explicitly solicited by the core development team as part of a planned initiative.

---

### VI. Reporting Critical Security Vulnerabilities

The only exception to the above is for reporting critical security or safety issues. If you discover a vulnerability that could compromise user safety, data, or violate the Linden Lab Third-Party Viewer Policy, **do not post it publicly on GitHub.**

Please report it immediately and privately using **[GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/ApertureViewer/Aperture-Viewer/security/advisories/new)**, as detailed in our main [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ApertureViewer/Aperture-Viewer/blob/dev/SECURITY.md) policy.

---

### VII. Our Commitment & Policy Updates

Our commitment is to developing a stable and powerful platform and to the security of our users. This policy is the operational framework that allows us to focus on that goal.

To ensure this policy remains effective, it is a living document and may be updated at any time as the project's needs evolve. The "Effective Date" at the top of this document will always reflect the latest version.

This policy is stated in compliance with the Linden Lab Third-Party Viewer Policy, Section 1.c.

Thank you for your understanding.
